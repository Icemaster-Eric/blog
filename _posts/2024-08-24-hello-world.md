```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

Yahallo~ I decided to start this blog after having a thought a few weeks ago (on the toilet, of course) - what if I suddenly passed away, or only had a few weeks left to live? After some pondering, I came to the conclusion that I'd be content to leave behind a book containing my life experiences. Who knows, maybe kids in the future will read my ramblings like it's the diary of Anne Frank, or something like that? Anyhow, I'd like this blog to just be a compilation of my random day-to-day experiences, achievements, and maybe even some fun stories about my past.

## Who, me?

I suppose an introduction is in order. As of the time of writing, I'm just your average, lost 16 year old who does a bit of programming on the side. I'll leave the part about my otaku tendencies to a future blog post, probably...

## Some lofty aspirations

I might've started this blog on a whim, but I do think that it'll be worth it. To make sure this doesn't end up like most of my unfinished projects, I'll set some goals:

- A blog post each day
- Spend at least 15 minutes writing the post
- Keep it fun and interesting

Honestly, I'll probably drop this after a few weeks, but only time will tell for now.

exit()
