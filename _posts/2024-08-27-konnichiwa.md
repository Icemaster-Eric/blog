皆さん、こんにちは！

Honestly, I haven't really felt like I've been improving much with each of my blog posts, but I guess this sort of thing takes time. Anyways, I'd like to talk about my goal of learning Japanese, and how it's going so far.

## Why learn Japanese?

> A weeb is a person who is interested in anime and Japanese culture.

I *am* going to Japan on my next summer vacation though, less than two months from now. I guess this counts as a valid reason? My parents are expecting *me* to be the translator, so...

## What I've done in terms of learning the language

Just for a bit of context, I've probably been watching anime for over 4 years at this point in time. Even while watching with subtitles, I've been able to pick up the native accent and the general meanings of a few words.

> *"Do you really think that watching anime with subtitles even remotely counts as learning Japanese? lmao"* - some random people *cough cough*

No, watching anime has not gotten me to fluency in any shape or form. Before I started studying, I wasn't even at N5[^1]. I *was* able to learn to pronounce words correctly though (being a native Chinese speaker, Japanese pitch accent was fairly simple to pick up). Anyways, here are the steps that I've taken up till this point:

- Learning the kana: I simply created my own Anki deck with mnemonics to remember each character.
- Core 2k: An Anki deck of the top 2000 most common Japanese words. (Still working on this)
- Minimal immersion: I've been watching Japanese vtubers and Japanese podcasts here and there.

## My Japanese strategy plan

Honestly, I've spent an unhealthy amount of time simply learning *how* to learn Japanese, so at this point I'm pretty sure I just need to stick to something and keep at it. I'm aiming to reach *at least* N2[^1], although I'm not sure about how realistic that is. Anyways, I'd like to wrap this up quickly so I can go do my homework, so here goes nothing:

- [] Finish Core 2k
- [] Start immersing 24/7
- [] Read Japanese light novels w/ Yomitan
    - [] Sentence mining?
- [] Vrchat to talk to Japanese people

## さよなら！

Anyways I'd really like to continue talking about some things, but I *really* need to do my homework now...
